## Project Name: Optimized Object Detection Model for Automated Skin Disease Analysis 
### ABSTRACT
This research examines the fully automated detection of skin diseases based on advanced object detection models trained on a customs-annotated dataset consisting of 7100 images, covering conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis. Optimized parameters of the model included the use of an auto-tuned optimizer with learning rate annealing and extra hyperparameter fitting, as these contribute to enhanced speed, accuracy, and model generalization during training. In general, the results reveal a very good precision recall trade-off by the proposed model, although some conditions, for example acne, need further refinement. Results have established the feasibility of an AI driven skin disease detection algorithm for the real-time diagnosis, while future works shall concentrate on the enhancement of the database and the hardware integration process.
